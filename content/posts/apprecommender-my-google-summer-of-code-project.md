title: "AppRecommender My Google Summer of Code Project"

AppRecommender is a package recommender system for Debian. This project is
also one of the Debian projects that is being worked on by some Google Summer of Code
students. As one of these students, I will now present what my Google Summer
of Code project is and what I have achieved so far.

First of all, my project is to allow AppStream to parse recommendations
provided by AppRecommender. AppStream is a project that aims at providing
cross-distribution metadata about components that can be installed by an user.

By allowing AppStream to parse AppRecommender recommendations, some software
centers that use AppStream data would also be able to display recommendations
provided by AppRecommender. This would be really good because AppRecommender works only
via terminal access in this moment, which is a huge restriction for some users.
Therefore, by allowing software centers to display recommendations to its users,
a new kind of user would be covered by AppRecommender.

With that said, this is the representation of the 0ad component on AppStream:

```xml
<component type="desktop">
    <id>0ad.desktop</id>
    <pkgname>0ad</pkgname>
    <name>0 A.D.</name>

```

With that idea in mind, I have been discussing with AppStream maintainers
about this idea for quite some time. I have tried to implement some approaches, but
so far, most of them are flawed. However, during DebConf I was able to talk
directly with Matthias Klump, the maintainer of AppStream, about this issue,
and we have thought about a possible solution.

The solution would be that an AppStream component would have a suggests tag
that would indicate which recommendation where generated by that component. For
example, given that the user has vim and git installed and AppRecommender
recommends vim-fugitive, the vim component would have the following
tag:

```xml
<component type="desktop">
    <id>vim.desktop</id>
    <pkgname>vim</pkgname>
    <name>Vim</name>
    <suggests type="heuristic">
      <id>vim-fugitive.desktop</id>
    </suggests>
</component>
```

Although a recommendation in AppRecommender is generated by a combination of
user packages and not a single package, this approach may still work.
That is because one of the strategies that will
be implemented on AppRecommender is to recommend packages just after the user has
installed a package. For example, if the user has installed a text editor,
AppRecommender would them look at the user already installed packages and
recommended packages related to both the already installed text editor and the
other packages the user already has.

This new strategy could them be applied for every package the user has
installed on the system, creating recommendations per package, which is exactly what
this new format for AppStream is about.

There are still some discussion about this idea, but I believe that we are
almost reaching a consensus about this new feature for AppStream :)
